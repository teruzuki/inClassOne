  	<p class="TID1">
  	TID1 is a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor lethal (2) tumerous imaginal discs, l(2)tid and encodes two mitochondrial matrix localized splice variants of human Tid-1 designated hTid-1S and hTid-1L. These proteins are the conserved members of the DnaJ family of proteins which act as cochaperons for mitochondrial Hsp70. They contain a conserved tetrahedrical J domain which binds to Hsp70 chaperones and activates their ATPase activity. Expression of hTid-1L increases apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents as mitomycin-C and TNF-alpha.

  	<p class="twinkle">
  	Twinkle is a mitochondrial protein with structural similarity to the phage T7 primase/helicase (GP4) and other hexameric ring helicases. The twinkle protein colocalizes with mtDNA in mitochondrial nucleoids, and its name derives from the unusual localization pattern reminiscent of twinkling stars.Twinkle is a mitochondrial protein with structural similarity to the phage T7 primase/helicase (GP4) and other hexameric ring helicases.

  	<p class="ERAB">
  	This gene encodes 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type II, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. The gene product is a mitochondrial protein that catalyzes the oxidation of a wide variety of fatty acids, alcohols, and steroids. The protein has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease, and mutations in the gene are the cause of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MHBD). Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but the full-length nature of only two transcript variants has been determined.
